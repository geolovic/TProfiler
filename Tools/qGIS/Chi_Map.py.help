", "ALG_DESC": "This script calculates the Chi map for a drainage network extracted from a DEM and using a Flow Accumulation raster to obtain drainage areas. DEM and Flow Accumulation raster must have the same dimensions and pixel size. Channels are extracted from heads using a flow threshold (in cells or map units). For each channel all the parameters (Chi, ksn, slope, area, distance, etc.) are calculated for each vertex (if the distance parameter is zero), or for segments of a fixed distance. If the distance parameter is zero, the result will be a point shapefile (points will correspond to channels vertexes). Slope and ksn will be calculated by linear regression on distance-elevation and chi-elevation spaces respectively, taking n channel vertexes up and down each point. If distance is not 0, each channel will be divided in segments of a fixed length and ksn and slope will be calculated for each segment using all its vertexes. In both cases, fields with R2 of regression will be given. ", "Segment_distance": "Distance to calculate all the parameters.
